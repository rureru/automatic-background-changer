# Auto Background Changer with timer
I offer you a python code with which you can automatically change the desktop background between certain hours.

## Setup
You can use any IDE for the code. My suggestion is Visual studio code or PyCharm.
## Usage
To prevent this, the code stops when the IDE is exited or the computer is turned off:
**for Linux/Unix:** The cron job scheduler is available. This allows the script to be run automatically at certain times or at certain intervals.
**for Windows:** The Windows Task Scheduler can be used. This allows code to be run automatically at specific times.
*Note: Such codes and programs can still cause performance degradation, even if it is not noticeable.*
